# SortingAlgorithms
My take on 5 sorting alogirthms.

5 sorting algorithms are 
1)Selection Sort
2)Bubble Sort
3)Insertion Sort
4)Merge Sort
5)Quick Sort


All the algorithms are written as a function in class called Sort (Sort.java). Create an Sort object instance and call the coresponding sorting method. Comments provide the working of sorting algorithm. 



Thank you.
